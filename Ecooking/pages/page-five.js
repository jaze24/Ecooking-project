        <p>We love multi-products, which - as the name suggests - can be used for several things in everyday life, making everything a little easier. With our Multi Oil of 100% cold pressed organic oils you are prepared for a little of each. Always remember to moisten with water before using the oil. The water helps the oil penetrate your skin.
        </p><br>
        <h6>1. Moisture to the skin</h6>
        <p>When you have finished your bath, Multi Oil is an easy and effective way to give moisture to your entire body in an instant. Drip your body and apply the oil to your moisturized skin.
        </p><br>
        <h6>2. Makeup remover</h6>
        <p>Moisten your face with water, remove oil on a moistened cotton swab and clean eye makeup. Take another cotton swab and cleanse the skin throughout the face in the same way.
        </p><br>
        <h6>3. Shaving - for both men and women</h6>
        <p>Whether it is shaving your body or face, you can use the oil instead of shaving cream - also for shaving. Moisten your skin with water, lubricate the area you want to shave, and allow it to soak for 10-20 seconds. It softens the hair and makes your skin ready for the scraper. After you cleanse your skin with oil, you shave off the shave for unpleasantness such as beard plague, ingrown hair and red buds. Also, lubricate the skin with oil as a shaving treatment and finish by moisturizing your skin with a day cream.
        </p><br>
        <h6>4. Moisture and glow to dry hair</h6>
        <p>Get some oil in your hands and brush over your hair when it is moist after the bath, from the scalp to the tips. Finally, collect the tips and squeeze the rest of the oil.
        </p><br>
        <h6>5. ...and for a dry scalp</h6>
        <p>Products, hair drying, wind and weather can all help to dry out your scalp, leaving it dry and scaly. A healthy scalp gives healthy hair, so give your scalp an oil cure occasionally so it is well moisturized. Moisten your hair with water and spread the oil with your fingertips on the scalp, massage it in and let it work for a quarter of an hour or overnight before washing your hair. Foam the shampoo with water in your hands and rub it into the oil-treated hair, then it is far easier to get the oil washed out. If you choose to sleep with the oil in your hair, it is a good idea to use an extra pillowcase that is not delicate.
        </p><br>
        <h6>6. For massage</h6>
        <p>When you use the oil for massage, you strike two flies with one stroke: you moisturize your skin and release tension. When you use the oil as a massage oil, you do not need to moisturize the skin first.
        </p><br>
        <h6>7. Base for bodyscrub</h6>
        <p>Mix your oil with bath salts in a 1:1 ratio and you have a nice and moisturizing body scrub that makes your skin soft and moisturized.
        </p><br>
        <h6>8. For bath and footbath</h6>
        <p>A tub or foot bath in peace and quiet is pure self-indulgence, yes, closest to therapy. With the oil in the water, your skin moisturizes as you enjoy, and in the foot bath, the oil softens the dry skin, which is then easier to get rid of.
        </p><br>
        <h6>9. For babies and children</h6>
        <p>When choosing the fragrance-free Multi Oil, you can safely and safely use it for bathing and caring for the youngest - from the little babies to the bigger kids.
